     * Allows iteration of the tree-like structure of containers
     * containing containers.
     *
     * Why we need to iterate:
     * We want to send 7 graphics at a time, to maximize efficiency.
     * If a container has say 10 graphics that need redrawing, we
     * want to send the first 7 then know to skip those 7 next time.
     * We need to skip them so that in case every time all of those
     * first 7 want redrawn again, we don't get stuck on them without
     * ever redrawing the next 3.
     *
     * Why 7 graphics at a time is efficient:
     * We can send 1, 2, 5, or 7. Sending any number involves some overhead
     * (like message headers, see ref_serial_data.hpp)
     * There is a constant amount of overhead for sending any number of graphics,
     * so sending 7 means there is a seventh as much overhead per graphic than
     * sending 1 at a time.
     *
     * Non containers (SimpleGraphicsObject's) are treated as containers
     * of 1 object (so getNext(0) returns the GraphicsObject itself,
     * then nullptr until resetIteration() is called). You can use the
     * result of this for an if statement, nullptr is falsey and an actual
     * GrapicsObject* is truey.
     *
     * Example traversal: A has B and Q, and B has X, Y, and Z, and Q, X, Y,
     * and Z are not containers: A looks like [X, Y, Z, Q] when traversing.
     *
     * This will only return SimpleGraphicsObject's, but making the return
     * type that might lead to a problematic circle, with SimpleGraphicsObject
     * and GraphicsObject including eachother.
